The Google Project is focused on developing an Autocomplete Search algorithm. This system provides suggestions to users as they type, improving the search experience by predicting possible completions based on partial input. A key feature of the algorithm is its ability to handle user spelling errors efficiently while balancing performance constraints such as memory usage and run-time efficiency.

Features:

Autocomplete Search: As users type, the algorithm offers suggestions, aiming to predict what they are searching for based on a predefined dataset.
Spelling Error Correction: The algorithm accounts for possible spelling mistakes in the userâ€™s input, improving the relevance and accuracy of search suggestions.
Performance Considerations: The system optimizes memory usage and run-time to ensure it can handle large datasets and return results in real-time.
